Q2: What happens (and why this happens) to the result blending from section 4 image when blending is performed with different image filters (filter_size_im = 1,3,5,7...)?
A2: Larger areas of the blended image get involved in the blend, we see colors from one image appearing further away from the mask boundaries than we saw with smaller filters.
